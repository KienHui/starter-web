Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment. (Kent Beck) Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves. (Alan Kay) Computers are useless. They can only give you answers. (Pablo Picasso) Software suppliers are trying to make their software packages more ‘user-friendly’… Their best approach so far has been to take all the old brochures and stamp the words ‘user-friendly’ on the cover. (Bill Gates) I don’t care if it works on your machine! We are not shipping your machine! (Vidiu Platon)
